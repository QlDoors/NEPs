### Simple Summary

This proposal proposes a transaction pricing mechanism, based on Ether [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559), for NewChain that forces to burn a minimum amount per block, while exempting the consensus layer transactions from network fee.

### Abstract

As described in [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559), we introduce a new
[EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transaction type,
with the format `0x02 || rlp([chain_id, nonce, max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit, destination, amount, data, access_list, signature_y_parity, signature_r, signature_s])`.

There is a base fee per gas in protocol, which can move up or down each block according to a formula which is a function of gas used in parent block and gas target (block gas limit divided by elasticity multiplier) of parent block.
The algorithm results in the base fee per gas increasing when blocks are above the gas target, and decreasing when blocks are below the gas target.
The base fee per gas is burned.
Transactions specify the maximum fee per gas they are willing to give to miners to incentivize them to include their transaction (aka: priority fee).
Transactions also specify the maximum fee per gas they are willing to pay total (aka: max fee), which covers both the priority fee and the block's network fee per gas (aka: base fee).
The transaction will always pay the base fee per gas of the block it was included in, and they will pay the priority fee per gas set in the transaction, as long as the combined amount of the two fees doesn't exceed the transaction's maximum fee per gas.

Newton makes a unique improvement on this basis by setting a minimum value of BaseFee, that each gas has a minimum burn fee, to avoid the problem of low minimum burn value of each gas due to low network transaction volume.
At the same time, the network fee for consensus layer transactions is exempted in order to be compatible with the characteristics of Newton consensus.

### Motivation

Newton historically priced transaction fees using a simple auction mechanism, where users send transactions with bids (“gasprices”) and miners choose transactions with the highest bids, and transactions that get included pay the bid that they specify. At the same time, Newton node miners functioning normally are able to receive consensus layer rewards NEWNEW so that miners receive both the user's transaction fee and the consensus layer rewards.

An important aspect of this fee system is that miners only get to keep the priority fee. The base fee is always burned (i.e. it is destroyed by the protocol).This ensures that only NEW can ever be used to pay for transactions on Newton, cementing the economic value of NEW within the Newton platform.
Additionally, this burn counterbalances Newton inflation while still giving the block reward and priority fee to miners.
Finally, ensuring the miner of a block does not receive the base fee is important because it removes miner incentive to manipulate the fee in order to extract more fees from users.

### Specification

As of `FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER`, the `BaseFee` of per block _MUST_ not less than `BaseFeeMin` where:

- `BaseFeeMin` is the minimum BaseFee and the value is `250000000000000`

_Note: `//` is integer division, round down._
